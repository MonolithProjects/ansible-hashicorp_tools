This Ansible Role will install/upgrade/uninstall Hashicorp tools.
Ansible Role does not use deb or rpm packages but installs the binaries directly from https://releases.hashicorp.com to the system.

- [Baundary](https://www.boundaryproject.io/)
- [consul](https://www.consul.io/)
- [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/)
- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
- [Waypoint](https://www.waypointproject.io/)

## Requirements

- Since the binaries are distributed inside of a Zip file, the role will automatically install `unzip` if it's not already on the system.

- In case you install `vagrant`, the role will automatically install `fuse` or `libfuse2` (depending on the packiging tool you system is using)

* Weekly tested on (but will run on older releases just fine):
  * CentOS 8
  * Debian 10
  * Fedora 32
  * Ubuntu 20

## Example Playbook

In this example the Ansible role will uninstall Hashicorp Boundary and install (or upgrade) the rest of the Hashicorp tools to specific release versions.

```yaml

      hashicorp_tools:
